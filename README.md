## Usage

Pomomato combines effective time management with focused note-taking, supported by smart summarization. The core experience centers on:

* Using the **Pomodoro Timer** on the main screen to structure your work into focus sessions and breaks  
* Taking **real-time notes in the side panel** during each Pomodoro session, allowing you to capture thoughts, progress, or ideas while you work  
* After each session, notes are **automatically summarized using the OpenAI API**, helping you retain key takeaways without manual effort  

The side panel is designed to be a powerful yet lightweight writing space. With integrated summarization, Pomomato becomes a personal productivity assistant that helps you work smarter, not just harder.
